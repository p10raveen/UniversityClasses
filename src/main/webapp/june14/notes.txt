Difference b/w GET and POST?
GET
---
-> Get Method produces a long string that appears in address bar.
-> Get method is restricted to send upto 1024 characters only.
-> never use GET method if you are using sensitive information.
-> By using GET method, we can only send text request.

POST
----
-> POST Method never produces a long string that appears in address bar.
-> POST method does not have ant restriction on data to be sent.
-> The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header and its security depends on HTTP Protocol.
->  By using POST method, we can send binary as well as text request.
